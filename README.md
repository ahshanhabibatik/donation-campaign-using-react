# Here are three additional features I can add to a donation campaign project:

User Authentication and Profiles:

  1.Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in securely.

  2.Create user profiles where users can view their donation history, manage their personal information, and track their contributions over time.

  3.This feature adds a personalized touch to your donation campaign and helps build trust among users.

Progress Tracking:

  1.Show a pie chart indicating the progress of the fundraising campaign. The chart can represent the percentage of the fundraising goal achieved, making it easy for donors to see how close the campaign is to reaching its target.

Donation Categories and Fund Allocation:
  1.Create categories or causes within your campaign and display them as options for donors.

  2.Allow donors to select a category for their donation, and store this information in local storage.

  3.Implement a system for campaign organizers to allocate funds to specific projects or initiatives within each category.
